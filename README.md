## ✨ Overview

CyberWall Scanner is more than just a tool; it's an educational platform. It provides a seamless experience for scanning web applications for a range of vulnerabilities, but its true power lies in its **AI-driven remediation guidance**. Instead of just pointing out flaws, CyberWall explains the "why" behind them and provides clear, actionable steps—including code examples—to fix them.

This project was built to make web security more accessible, turning complex vulnerabilities into learning opportunities for developers, security enthusiasts, and students.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **🎯 Comprehensive Scanning:** Test for a wide array of vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Broken Authentication, and more.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Remediation:** Get clear, step-by-step instructions and code examples generated by an AI expert to help you fix vulnerabilities quickly and correctly.
- **📊 Detailed Reporting:** View scan results in a clean, organized dashboard. Prioritize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **📄 PDF Report Downloads:** Generate professional PDF reports for your scans to share with your team or keep for your records.
- **👤 User Authentication:** Secure user accounts with Firebase Authentication, including sign-up, login, and password reset functionality.
- **👑 Admin Dashboard:** A protected route for administrators to view all registered users and every scan performed across the platform.
- **📚 Educational Resources:** Dedicated pages explaining the nature and impact of each vulnerability type, a great study resource.
- **🎨 Sleek & Responsive UI:** A modern, fully responsive interface built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN/UI.
